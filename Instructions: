Instructions:

Create a directory named static in the same directory as the Python script.
Place your static files (HTML, CSS, images) inside the static directory.
Run the Python script, and the server will start running on the specified port (default is 8000).
Access the server in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000.
